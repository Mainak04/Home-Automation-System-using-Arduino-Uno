# Home-Automation-System-using-Arduino-Uno
This project features an advanced home automation system using an Arduino UNO and ESP8266 WiFi module, enabling control of appliances via a relay, manual switches, and mobile app. A clap sensor allows hands-free operation by detecting sound, while the ESP8266 provides remote management from anywhere.
